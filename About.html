                    alt="Mardi Gras Parade, New_Orleans, Louisiana">
                The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in southern Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                Celebrations are
                concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the
                start of lent in
                the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many
                days have
                several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
                Gras season. In
                the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades
                and balls (some
                of them masquerade balls).

                The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
                schedule and route
                each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the
                Knights of Momus and
                the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events
                (often featuring
                celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the Zulu Social Aid &
                Pleasure Clubâ€”a
                predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most
                common throws are
                strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", and small inexpensive
                toys. Major krewes
                follow the same parade schedule and route each year.

                While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate
                in the Uptown and
                Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of
                the French
                Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in
                the Faubourg
                Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras Day. Mardi Gras Day traditionally
                concludes with the
                "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.

            <h1>History</h1>
            <h4>Early history</h4>
            <p class="info">The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the
                Mississippi River in
                what is now
                lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men celebrated it
                as part of an
                observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is
                unknown. A 1730
                account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming (including
                cross-dressing).
                An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing
                of masks in the
                streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed
                whenever such
                restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned.

                In 1833, Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent raised money
                to fund an
                official Mardi Gras celebration. James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other
                Miscellaneous Pieces
                describes New Orleans Mardi Gras in 1835
                <img id="TheCarnival" src="images/800px-The_Carnival_at_New_Orleans-About.jpg" alt="">

                The Carnival at New Orleans, 1885
                Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun,
                frolic, and comic
                masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation. Men and boys,
                women and
                girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and appear in
                grotesque, quizzical,
                diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and birds,
                beasts and birds
                with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from
                the moon;
                mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts,
                coaches, cars,
                &c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming, fiddling,
                fifeing, and
                all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way.

                In 1856, 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society to
                observe Mardi Gras
                with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mistick Krewe of Comus.
                According to one
                historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what New Orleans had always considered
                a French
                festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade that the lead in the holiday had
                passed from
                French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and
                its Creoles. To a
                certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of
                how their business
                prowess helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized
                Carnival passed from
                Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the course of the nineteenth century.
                The spectacle of
                Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms
                and on the
                streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely
                American."

                In 1875, Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday.War, economic, political, and weather
                conditions
                sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American Civil War,
                World War I and
                World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.

                The 1898, Rex parade, with the theme of "Harvest Queens," was filmed by the American Mutoscope Co. The
                rumored but
                long-lost recording was rediscovered in 2022. The two-minute film records 6 parade floats, including one
                transporting a
                live ox. In December of 2022, the film was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically
                significant" by the
                National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.

                LaToya Cantrell (nÃ©e Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New
                Orleans,
                Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office. Before becoming
                mayor, Cantrell
                represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012â€“2018
            </p>
            <h4>Early life and education</h4>
            <P class="info">Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to
                attend Xavier
                University of
                Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology. She attended an executive training program at the
                Harvard Kennedy
                School.</P>
            <h4>Broadmoor neighborhood work</h4>
            <p class="info">Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor neighborhood. In 2003,
                she joined the
                board of the
                Broadmoor Improvement Association and became president of the association in 2004. After the 2005
                levee failures in
                Greater New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, the Broadmoor neighborhood flooded severely and
                remained mostly
                deserted for months afterward. In early 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, a blue-ribbon panel
                convened by
                then-mayor Ray Nagin, released a recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five other New Orleans
                neighborhoods to be
                converted into greenspace. In her role as president of the association, Cantrell worked with residents
                and local
                religious leaders to organize opposition to the panel's recommendation. She also helped enlist returning
                Broadmoor
                residents in a six-month effort to write a recovery plan for the neighborhood.

                Cantrell worked full time to implement Broadmoor's recovery plan from 2006 through 2012. She and fellow
                residents formed
                the Broadmoor School Board, overseeing the reopening and renovation of the Andrew H. Wilson school. She
                served as a
                founding board member of the Broadmoor Development Corporation, a community development corporation that
                provided case
                management and other social services for returning residents. She was involved with residents' efforts
                to reopen
                Broadmoor's Rosa F. Keller Library, which won a $2 million grant from the Carnegie Endowment.She created
                a
                partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and Church of the Annunciation, which provided
                the
                neighborhood association with office space and hosted volunteer groups.She also formed a partnership
                between the
                Broadmoor Improvement Association and her home parish, Blessed Trinity Catholic Church, to open the
                Broadmoor Art and
                Wellness Center.</p>
            <h4>Political career - New Orleans City Council</h4>
            <p class="info">In 2012, Cantrell declared her candidacy for the New Orleans City Council seat vacated when
                former
                District B
                representative Stacy Head won an election to an at-large position. After the November election,
                candidate Dana Kaplan
                and Cantrell advanced to a December runoff, which Cantrell won with 54 percent of the vote. Cantrell
                served out the
                balance of Head's term, and was unopposed for a full four-year term in 2014.

                As a council member, Cantrell focused on health, housing, and criminal-justice issues. She introduced a
                bill banning
                smoking at restaurants and bars within New Orleans, citing the health effects of secondhand smoke on
                service industry
                workers. The council unanimously passed the bill in 2015.

                Also in 2015, Cantrell began work to open a low-barrier homeless shelter, a move that was objected to by
                residents
                because of its proposed placement in Central City, New Orleans. Instead, the shelter was moved to the
                downtown site of
                the former VA Hospital. In 2017, Cantrell introduced legislation with at-large council member Jason
                Williams to
                register and inspect rental units in the city.

                As a member of the Criminal Justice Committee, Cantrell has participated in efforts to install crime
                cameras in her
                district, assess the effectiveness of citywide anti-gun-violence campaigns, and address understaffing at
                the New Orleans
                Police Department.</p>
