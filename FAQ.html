                What is Mardi Gras and why is it celebrated?</button>
            <div id="1" class="content">
                <p>Mardi Gras dates back thousands of years to pagan celebrations of spring and fertility. When
                    Christianity arrived in
                    Rome, religious leaders decided to incorporate the popular tradition into the new faith, so the
                    excess and debauchery of
                    the Carnival season became a prelude to Lent, the 40 days of penance between Ash Wednesday and
                    Easter. Mardi Gras marks
                    the final day of feasting and revelry before the fasting, prayer and moderation of Lent. So, in its
                    most basic form,
                    Carnival and Mardi Gras is all about overindulging.</p>

                When is Mardi Gras?</button>
            <div id="2" class="content">
                <p>Mardi Gras is French for Fat Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday, or the beginning of Lent. The
                    term refers to the
                    last chance to eat rich, fatty foods - and for many, the last chance to drink copious amounts of
                    alcohol -- before the
                    Lenten season and its penance, which for many includes giving up something for the 40 days between
                    Ash Wednesday and
                    Easter.

                    A common misconception is that Mardi Gras is the name for all of the revelry that begins Jan. 6 and
                    continues through
                    Ash Wednesday. This season of revelry is called Carnival; Mardi Gras is the culmination of it all.

                    The day Carnival season officially begins, Jan. 6, is the Feast of the Epiphany, also known as
                    Twelfth Night or Kings
                    Day. Traditionally, this is the day the first king cakes are eaten.</p>

                What is king cake all about?</button>
            <div id="3" class="content">
                <p>King cakes are traditionally served for the first time on Jan. 6, or Kings Day, and are enjoyed
                    throughout the Carnival
                    season. A traditional king cake is a braided cinnamon-laced brioche-like cake topped with icing and
                    colored sugars:
                    purple, green and gold, symbolizing justice, faith and power.

                    Other cultures celebrate Jan. 6 with king cakes as well: In England in the early 19th century, for
                    example, people would
                    eat bits of the "twelfth night cake" in hopes of finding a bean or pea. Whoever found the bean would
                    get to masquerade
                    as a king or queen for the night. In some Spanish-speaking countries, beans or peas are still
                    used.Many bakeries now
                    offer king cakes with fillings of fruit, cream cheese, even chocolate. A small plastic baby is
                    placed inside the cake to
                    symbolize the baby Jesus; the person who gets the piece of cake with the baby is responsible for
                    buying the next king
                    cake, usually within the next week.</p>

                Is New Orleans the only place Mardi Gras is celebrated?</button>
            <div id="4" class="content">
                <p>Absolutely not! New Orleans might have the biggest parades and biggest parties throughout the
                    Carnival season, but other
                    cities across Louisiana, including Baton Rouge, join in on the fun. Mobile, Ala., also holds a big
                    Mardi Gras
                    celebration.

                    Outside Louisiana, the most well-known festivals are in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Cologne, Germany;
                    and Italy.

                In Baton Rouge, what's with all the flamingos at the parades?</button>
            <div id="5" class="content">
                <p>Pink flamingos are an integral part of the Spanish Town Parade, which rolls the weekend before Mardi
                    Gras in Baton
                    Rouge. Flamingos are the somewhat official mascot of the Spanish Town residents. Residents of this
                    historic Baton Rouge
                    community have traditionally bonded over their differences, a fact those residents are proud to
                    recognize.

                    "Today, the neighborhood still has a unique sense of community -- a sense of difference. To
                    symbolize our difference
                    from the rest of Baton Rouge, my neighbors and I have adopted the pink flamingo as our mascot,"
                    writes Jocelyn Donlon on
                    The Spanish Town Mardi Gras website.

                    Spanish Town resident Charles Fisher says he was there for the beginning of the flamingo craze,
                    which began in the early
                    1980s.

                    "I do remember talk of 'this is tacky, that is tacky' and so on," Fisher wrote in an email to
                    NOLA.com. "(Spanish Town
                    resident) Clyde Carlson (found) an ad for flamingos in Old House Magazine that was headed 'RUIN YOUR
                    NEIGHBORHOOD.'
                    Several of us then placed our orders and away it went. The old flyers from the early 1980s and all
                    my letters always
                    read 'Plant a Flamingo'."

                    Spanish Town was planned in 1805 and is the oldest neighborhood in Baton Rouge. The area is marked
                    by narrow streets,
                    old buildings, little parking and lots of history.
